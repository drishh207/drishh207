## üìö Projects

### TravelVista
_April 2024_ | **NodeJS, JavaScript, Python, Large Language Models: RAG, LangChain, DistilBERT, Tensorflow**

- Developed a personalized travel planner system, incorporating information retrieval principles to offer contextual destination recommendations and personalized itineraries.
- Utilized advanced language models like BERT, GPT, and DistilBERT, alongside manually optimized datasets, to enhance recommendation accuracy and user engagement tracking.
- Designed an intuitive user interface featuring query-based city recommendations and proximity-based hotel suggestions, streamlining the trip planning process and improving user experience.

### Benchfaas Setup
_April 2024_ | **Edge Computing, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes (k3s), Nebula, Openfaas**

- Created an edge computing network using jetsen nanos, connected via an overlay network - Nebula.
- K3s master and worker network is created, master being the Nebula lighthouse and other nodes being the worker nodes.
- Openfaas installed and deployed on all nodes, while the Openfaas functions deployed only on the worker nodes.
- Benchfaas deployed on a server/tester machine and requests sent to all the functions on different edge devices. Project to be continued for the whole year.

### Performance Comparison of IPv4 and IPv6
_November 2023_ | **Linux, Python, Matplotlib**

- Conducted comparative analysis of ping latency for IPv4 and IPv6 across 100 websites, with 40 ping requests sent per website, utilizing geolocation and traceroute data.
- Employed advanced data visualization techniques to analyze and present the results, including plots and graphs, to discern trends and patterns in ping latency between IPv4 and IPv6.
- Provided insightful analysis and interpretation of the data, offering valuable insights into network performance and potential implications for internet protocol adoption strategies.

### Linux Shell in C++
_November 2023_ | **C++, Multithreading**

- Developed C++ implementations of Linux commands including `cd`, `mv`, `rm`, `cp`, and `ls`, featuring at least 4 distinct options per command, with the exclusion of recursive functionality for `cd`.
- Utilized multithreading techniques to enhance performance and efficiency of recursive options across commands, conducting time difference analysis to measure the impact of multithreading on execution time.
